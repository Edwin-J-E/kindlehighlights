how you think when you lose determines how long it will be until you win. The answer for thinking right toward people when things don’t go exactly our way comes from Benjamin Fairless, one of the 20th century’s most outstanding persons.

I have also liked every boss I ever had. I

salvage something from every setback. When a setback hits us personally, our first impulse is often to become so emotionally upset that we fail to learn the lesson. Professors know that a student’s reaction to a failing grade provides a clue to his success potential.

He had already made graduation plans, and canceling was embarrassing. He was left with two alternatives: retake and pass the course and receive his degree at a later graduation, or quit school without earning a degree.
